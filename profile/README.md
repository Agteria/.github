## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

We're on a mission to reduce 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions. We collaborate with leading global experts to conduct rigorous studies and generate high quality products based on research backed data. Our first product AB-01 reporesents our larger vision of making agriculture net zero by building products that reduce greenhouse gasses.
